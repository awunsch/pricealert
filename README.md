## Description
This free module will let your customers easily create price alerts on products and combinations. They will receive email when price drops below indicated threshold.

Not only is this a powerful incentive for them to return to your shop, but it also gives you interesting information - email addresses and expected price. You can use it to optimise your pricing strategy or for other marketing purposes.
